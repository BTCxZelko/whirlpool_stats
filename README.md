## Data Sources

These scripts rely on snapshots of Whirpool's transaction graph computed by the OXT platform.

These snapshots can be downloaded at the urls:
- https://oxt.me/static/share/whirlpool/whirlpool_mix_txs_<denom>.csv (list of mix transactions)
- https://oxt.me/static/share/whirlpool/whirlpool_tx0s_<denom>.csv (list of mix tx0s)
- https://oxt.me/static/share/whirlpool/whirlpool_links_<denom>.csv (list of edges between the transactions)
where <denom> is a code identifying the pool denomination (valid codes = 05, 005, 001)
